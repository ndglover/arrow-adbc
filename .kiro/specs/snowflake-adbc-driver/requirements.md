# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing a native C# Snowflake driver for the Apache Arrow ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) project. The driver will provide native C# connectivity to Snowflake databases, replacing the current Interop wrapper approach with a direct implementation that takes inspiration from the official Snowflake.Data .NET connector while implementing native Arrow format support and conforming to ADBC API standards.
